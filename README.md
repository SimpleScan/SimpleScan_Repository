SimpleScan README:

SimpleScan is a mobile application with the intention of providing a simple and effective way of managing oneâ€™s expenses,
while allowing easy sharing of those expenses with others who are involved.  Users can view previous expenses, maintain a budget,
split bills, set bill reminders, and, utilizing our photo recognition software, can even scan receipts and bills right into the
application for better management of finances.
